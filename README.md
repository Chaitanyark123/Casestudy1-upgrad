Lending Case Study
Intent of the Analysis:

Lending loans and recovering them has always been a mountainous task. For most lending companies, lending loans to 'risky' applicants has been the source of largest finacial loss famously known as 'credit loss'. Credit Loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay.

Our Intent here is to indentify the key factors, which can help in finding the potential loan defaulters, based on the given dataset of Borrowers information for 4years(2007-2011), by using EDA. 


The steps followed in finding the potential defaulters:

Step 1: Understanding the Dataset and identifying the most usefull subset data.
Step 2: Cleaning the data.
Step 3: Univariate/Segmented Univariate Analysis.
Step 4: Bivariate Analysis.
Step 5: Results.

Technologies used:
Python incorporated with Pandas, Numpy, seaborn modules.
Git.
